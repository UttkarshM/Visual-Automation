This is a sample text file for testing the file upload and text extraction functionality.

It contains multiple lines of text that should be processed by the file-to-text node.

The file processor should be able to:
1. Read this plain text file
2. Extract all the content
3. Return it as processed text

This is useful for testing workflows that involve file processing and text extraction.
